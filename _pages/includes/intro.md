I am a is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Department of Computer Science, Dartmouth College, working with [Prof. Andrew Campbell](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/). Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Cambridge, advised by [Prof. Cecilia Mascolo](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/).

My research focuses on the development of multisensory AI systems to enhance healthcare applications. I specialize in creating generalizable, deep learning models that integrate multiple mobile and wearables signals, such as EEG, ECG, and PPG, to monitor and improve well-being.
