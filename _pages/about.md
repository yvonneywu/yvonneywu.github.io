Hi! I am Yvonne, a PhD student in the [Mobile System Group](https://mobile-systems.cl.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Cecilia Mascolo](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/). My research is supported by the Nokia Bell Labs. 

My research interests lie in deep learning applications, especially in mobile systems and healthcare. I am interested in developing more generalizable and interpretable deep learning methods for sequential systems, and using them to accelerate scientific discovery. 
The research projects that I worked on, or am actively working on include:
* **Representation learning for biosignals**
* **Generalizable deep learning**
