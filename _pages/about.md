Hi! I am Yvonne, a PhD student in the [Mobile System Group](https://mobile-systems.cl.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Cecilia Mascolo](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/). My research journey is generously supported by Nokia Bell Labs.

My research interests focus on building better artificial intelligence to understand, model and intervene time-series data (e.g., wearables or biosignals) to improve health and well-being. The research projects I have been involved in, or am currently working on, include:
* **Representation learning for time series data**: Learning without explicit human annotation for complex time series (e.g., non-stationarity, irregularity) through self-supervision
* **Transfer learning**: Exploring domain adaptation and generalization to tackle distribution shift challenges.

### News
* Our paper [UDAMA: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Through Multi Discriminator Adversarial Training With Noisy Labels Improves Cardio Fitness Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16651) has been accepted by Machine Learning for Healthcare 2023 .

* I received the travel award (by DeepMind) MLHC'23!
