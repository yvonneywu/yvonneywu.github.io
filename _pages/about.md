Hi! I am Yvonne, a PhD student in the [Mobile System Group](https://mobile-systems.cl.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Cecilia Mascolo](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/). My research journey is generously supported by Nokia Bell Labs.

My research interests focus on building human-centered systems, incorporating wearable sensing technologies and advanced learning algorithms. Specifically, my work include:
* **Accessible Health Sensing**: Exploring novel sensing modalities without specialized equipment, such as earables, to enable fitness and well-being monitoring.
* **AI for Sequential & Multimodal Data**: Advancing the development of foundation models using self-supervised learning techniques to analyze fine-grained, person-generated
sequential and multimodal data.
* **Trustworthy Deep Learning:**: Improving the robustness and generalization in deep learning for more reliable health outcome predictions.
